# Network Connectivity

In Module Two you'll learn how to analyze the connectivity of a network based on measures of distance, reachability, and redundancy of paths between nodes. In the assignment, you will practice using NetworkX to compute measures of connectivity of a network of email communication among the employees of a mid-size manufacturing company.

## Learning Objectives

- Describe how distance measures can be used to identify central and peripheral nodes in networks and use networkX to identify central and peripheral nodes.
- Define connected components in directed and undirected graphs and use networkX to find them.
- Identify ways of measuring clustering in networks and distinguish the differences in the measures.
- Measure clustering in graphs in NetworkX.
- Identify different types of network attacks and relate them to real world examples.
- Define node and edge connectivity of a network and describe their implication to network robustness.
- Assess how resistant a network is to node and edge removal attacks, using networkX
