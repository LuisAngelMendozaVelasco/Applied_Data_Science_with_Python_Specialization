# Why Study Networks and Basics on NetworkX

Module One introduces you to different types of networks in the real world and why we study them. You'll learn about the basic elements of networks, as well as different types of networks. You'll also learn how to represent and manipulate networked data using the NetworkX library. The assignment will give you an opportunity to use NetworkX to analyze a networked dataset of employees in a small company.

## Learning Objectives

- Recognize and categorize real world networks.
- Identify applications and important questions about networks that network science allows us to answer.
- Determine what type of network is best suited to model real networked data.
- Construct and manipulate networks of different types using different network classes and node and edge attributes in NetworkX.
- Define bipartite graphs and describe related algorithms such as graph projections.
- Manipulate bipartite graphs and related algorithms using NetworkX.
