# Influence Measures and Network Centralization

In Module Three, you'll explore ways of measuring the importance or centrality of a node in a network, using measures such as Degree, Closeness, and Betweenness centrality, Page Rank, and Hubs and Authorities. You'll learn about the assumptions each measure makes, the algorithms we can use to compute them, and the different functions available on NetworkX to measure centrality. In the assignment, you'll practice choosing the most appropriate centrality measure on a real-world setting.

## Learning Objectives

- Identify and define several network centrality measures.
- Describe the differences and similarities between several centrality measures.
- Measure the centrality of nodes in a network using NetworkX.
- Describe how network centrality measures can be used for real world applications.
- Apply centrality analysis to real world networks.
