# Network Evolution

In Module Four, you'll explore the evolution of networks over time, including the different models that generate networks with realistic features, such as the Preferential Attachment Model and Small World Networks. You will also explore the link prediction problem, where you will learn useful features that can predict whether a pair of disconnected nodes will be connected in the future. In the assignment, you will be challenged to identify which model generated a given network. Additionally, you will have the opportunity to combine different concepts of the course by predicting the salary, position, and future connections of the employees of a company using their logs of email exchanges.

## Learning Objectives

- Define the degree distribution of a network and use networkX to visualize it.
- Identify the typical properties of real, large networks such as power law like degree distribution, high clustering, and small average shortest paths.
- Describe the mechanics of the Preferential Attachment Model and identify the properties of the networks it generates.
- Describe the mechanics of the Small World Model and identify the properties of the networks it generates.
- Identify and describe several network measures that can be used for link prediction.
- Use NetworkX to create node pair features that are predictive of new edges.
- Use NetworkX to create node features that are predictive of node attributes in a real world setting.
