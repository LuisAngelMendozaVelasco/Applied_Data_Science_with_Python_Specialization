    "In this lecture we're going to talk about pattern matching in strings using regular expressions. Regular expressions, or regexes, are written in a condensed formatting language. In general, you can think of a regular expression as a pattern which you give to a regex processor with some source data. The processor then parses that source data using that pattern, and returns chunks of text back to the a data scientist or  programmer for further manipulation. There's really three main reasons you would want to do this - to check whether a pattern exists within some source data, to get all instances of a complex pattern from some source data, or to clean your source data using a pattern generally through string splitting. Regexes are not trivial, but they are a foundational technique for data cleaning in data science applications, and a solid understanding of regexs will help you quickly and efficiently manipulate text data for further data science application.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, you could teach a whole course on regular expressions alone, especially if you wanted to demystify how the regex parsing engine works and efficient mechanisms for parsing text. In this lecture I want to give you basic understanding of how regex works - enough knowledge that, with a little directed sleuthing, you'll be able to make sense of the regex patterns you see others use, and you can build up your practical knowledge of how to use regexes to improve your data cleaning. By the end of this lecture, you will understand the basics of regular expressions, how to define patterns for matching, how to apply these patterns to strings, and how to use the results of those patterns in data processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, a note that in order to best learn regexes you need to write regexes. I encourage you to stop the video at any time and try out new patterns or syntax you learn at any time."

With several exceptions, schools must have a student's consent prior to the disclosure of education records after that student is 18 years old. The law applies only to educational agencies and institutions that receive funds under a program administered by the U.S. Department of Education.\n",

      "Examples of situations affected by FERPA include school employees divulging information to anyone other than the student about the student's grades or behavior, and school work posted on a bulletin board with a grade. Generally, schools must have written permission from the parent or eligible student in order to release any information from a student's education record.\n",

      "\n",
      "FERPA also permits a school to disclose personally identifiable information from education records of an \"eligible student\" (a student age 18 or older or enrolled in a postsecondary institution at any age) to his or her parents if the student is a \"dependent student\" as that term is defined in Section 152 of the Internal Revenue Code. Generally, if either parent has claimed the student as a dependent on the parent's most recent income tax statement, the school may non-consensually disclose the student's education records to both parents.[3]\n",

Falvo case, an important part of the debate was determining the relationship between peer-grading and \"education records\" as defined in FERPA. In the Court of Appeals, it was ruled that students placing grades on the work of other students made such work into an \"education record.\" Thus, peer-grading was determined as a violation of FERPA privacy policies because students had access to other students' academic performance without full consent.[5] However, when the case went to the Supreme Court, it was officially ruled that peer-grading was not a violation of FERPA. This is because a grade written on a student's work does not become an \"education record\" until the teacher writes the final grade into a grade book.[6]\n",
