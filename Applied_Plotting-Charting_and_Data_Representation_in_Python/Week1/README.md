# Module 1: Principles of Information Visualization

In this module, you will get an introduction to principles of information visualization. We will be introduced to tools for thinking about design and graphical heuristics for thinking about creating effective visualizations. All of the course information on grading, prerequisites, and expectations are on the course syllabus, which is included in this module.

# Learning Objectives

- Choose a graphic that displays misleading information
- Interpret the features of the graphic in order to identify the mechanism(s) that is/are used by the "encoder" to mislead the "decoder"
- Analyze the graphic and use principles from Alberto Cairo's work to explain how the graphic is misleading
- Create a radar plot in order to reflect on the complexity of the misleading graphic
