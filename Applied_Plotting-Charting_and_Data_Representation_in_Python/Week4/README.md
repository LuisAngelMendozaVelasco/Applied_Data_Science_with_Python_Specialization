# Module 4: Applied Visualizations

In this module, then everything starts to come together. Your final assignment is entitled “Becoming a Data Scientist.” This assignment requires that you identify at least two publicly accessible datasets from the same region that are consistent across a meaningful dimension. You will state a research question that can be answered using these data sets and then create a visual using matplotlib that addresses your stated research question. You will then be asked to justify how your visual addresses your research question.

## Learning Objectives

- Identify two publicly accessible datasets from the same region that are consistent across a meaningful dimension
- State a research question that can be answered using two publicly accessible datasets
- Create a visual using matplotlib that addresses your stated research question
- Justify how the visual addresses your research question
