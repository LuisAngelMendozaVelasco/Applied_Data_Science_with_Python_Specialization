# Module 3: Charting Fundamentals

In this module you will explore charting fundamentals. For this weekâ€™s assignment you will work to implement a new visualization technique based on academic research. This assignment is flexible and you can address it using a variety of difficulties - from an easy static image to an interactive chart where users can set ranges of values to be used.

## Learning Objectives

- Build more complex features using base features (i.e., artists)
- Create new ways of visualizing the data by expanding the matplotlib codebase
- Use subplots to combine plots into a single figure
- Create insightful plots such as histograms, box plots, and histograms
- Create animated and interactive visualizations
