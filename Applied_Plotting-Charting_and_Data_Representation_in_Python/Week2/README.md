# Module 2: Basic Charting

In this module, you will delve into basic charting. For this weekâ€™s assignment, you will work with real world CSV weather data. You will manipulate the data to display the minimum and maximum temperature for a range of dates and demonstrate that you know how to create a line graph using matplotlib. Additionally, you will demonstrate the procedure of composite charts, by overlaying a scatter plot of record breaking data for a given year.

## Learning Objectives

- Work with real world CSV data
- Know how to create a line graph using matplotlib
- Manipulate data to get the minimum and maximum temperature
- Demonstrate procedure of composite charts
