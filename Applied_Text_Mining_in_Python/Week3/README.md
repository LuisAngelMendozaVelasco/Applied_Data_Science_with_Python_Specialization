# Module 3: Classification of Text

## Learning Objectives

- Compare text classification to other classification approaches (covered in Applied Machine Learning in Python as well)
- Describe the Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machine algorithms
- Classify text in two classes using one of these approaches in Python
- Identify and extract features from text and transform them into feature vectors for the machine learning models
