# Module 2: Supervised Machine Learning - Part 1

This module delves into a wider variety of supervised learning methods for both classification and regression, learning about the connection between model complexity and generalization performance, the importance of proper feature scaling, and how to control model complexity by applying techniques like regularization to avoid overfitting. In addition to k-nearest neighbors, this week covers linear regression (least-squares, ridge, lasso, and polynomial regression), logistic regression, support vector machines, the use of cross-validation for model evaluation, and decision trees.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand how different supervised learning algorithms - in particular, those based on linear models - estimate their own parameters from data to make new predictions.
- Understand the strengths and weaknesses of particular supervised learning methods in order to apply the right algorithm for a given task.
- Apply specific supervised machine learning algorithms in Python with scikit-learn.
- Recognize general principles of supervised machine learning that are common across algorithms, such as the connection between model complexity and generalization performance.
- Apply techniques like regularization, feature scaling, and cross-validation to avoid common pitfalls like under- and overfitting.
