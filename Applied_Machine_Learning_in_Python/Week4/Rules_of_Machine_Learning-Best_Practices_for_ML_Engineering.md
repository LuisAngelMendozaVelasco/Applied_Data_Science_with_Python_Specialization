# Rules of Machine Learning: Best Practices for ML Engineering (optional)

This optional reading is intended mainly for software engineers who want to build and deploy machine learning applications in production - especially at scale. The only background knowledge required are the basic machine learning concepts we've covered so far in this course.  Written by Google's Dr. Martin Zinkevich,  it walks through a set of software engineering best practices for designing and deploying machine learning in software systems - based on years of practical experience at Google.
