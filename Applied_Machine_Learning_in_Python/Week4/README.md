# Module 4: Supervised Machine Learning - Part 2

This module covers more advanced supervised learning methods that include ensembles of trees (random forests, gradient boosted trees), and neural networks (with an optional summary on deep learning). You will also learn about the critical problem of data leakage in machine learning and how to detect and avoid it.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand how specific supervised learning algorithms - in particular, those based on decision trees and neural networks - estimate their own parameters from data to make new predictions.
- Apply the right algorithm for a given task by understanding the strengths and weaknesses of additional supervised learning methods.
- Apply additional types of supervised machine learning algorithms in Python with scikit-learn.
- Recognize and avoid instances of data leakage
