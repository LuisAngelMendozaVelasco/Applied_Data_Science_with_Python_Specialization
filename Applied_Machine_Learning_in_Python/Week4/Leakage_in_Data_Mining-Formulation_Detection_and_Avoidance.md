# Leakage in Data Mining: Formulation, Detection, and Avoidance (optional)

If you want an example in more depth of how data scientists are exploring ways to detect and avoid data leakage, this technical article proposes one approach: a two-stage process based on "legitimacy tags".

If you're just interested in getting a little more background on the problem along with interesting examples, Sections 1 and 2 (Introduction and Related Work) are also useful to read on their own.
