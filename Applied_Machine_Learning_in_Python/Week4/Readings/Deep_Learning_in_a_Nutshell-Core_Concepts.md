# Deep Learning in a Nutshell: Core Concepts (optional)

This self-contained tutorial by Tim Dettmers covers the key high-level concepts of deep learning and reinforces the basic concepts we covered in the Neural Networks and Deep Learning lectures.  There are multiple parts - Part 1 is less technical while Parts 2-4 go into more detail on algorithms.
