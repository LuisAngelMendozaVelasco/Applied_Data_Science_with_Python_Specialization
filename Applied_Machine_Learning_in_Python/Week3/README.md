# Module 3: Evaluation

This module covers evaluation and model selection methods that you can use to help understand and optimize the performance of your machine learning models.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand why accuracy alone can be an inadequate metric for getting a more complete picture of a classifier's performance
- Understand the motivation and definition of a variety of important evaluation metrics in machine learning and how to interpret the results of using a given evaluation metric
- Optimize a machine learning algorithm using a specific evaluation metric appropriate for a given task
