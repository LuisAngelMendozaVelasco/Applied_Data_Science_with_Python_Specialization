# Practical Guide to Controlled Experiments on the Web (optional)

Beyond the essential evaluation metrics covered in this course, online controlled experiments, which involve A-B testing and other techniques, are perhaps the most important way that machine learning algorithms are evaluated for real-world use in Web and other online applications.  This article by Ron Kohavi, Randal Henne, and Dan Sommerfield, reviews the key points of running controlled experiments, along with important engineering issues and limitations to keep in mind when using them.
