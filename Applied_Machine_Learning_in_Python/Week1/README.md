# Module 1: Fundamentals of Machine Learning - Intro to SciKit Learn

This module introduces basic machine learning concepts, tasks, and workflow using an example classification problem based on the K-nearest neighbors method, and implemented using the scikit-learn library.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand basic machine learning concepts and workflow
- Distinguish between different types of machine learning tasks, based on examples of how they are applied to real-world problems
- Understand how a basic classification algorithm (k-nearest neighbors) learns and makes predictions
- Build and evaluate a basic k-nearest neighbors classifier on an example dataset using Python and scikit-learn
